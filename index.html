            <p class="second_p_harmon">"Before joining the bootcamp, i have never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                and staff did not dissapoint.They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.The
                agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                tutiral could ever have.In fact, i have often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my
                developent experience.In certailnly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers.100% reccomend!."</p>
